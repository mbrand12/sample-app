# Sample-app development diary
> DEVCORE because diary doesn't sound as cool.

In here I will write my observations, motivations and development details.

## Motivation

Since I now have a better grasp of the ruby language the next thing is to
revisit the sample_app from [railstutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) and
go over it once again, while adding some new things and solidifying old ones.

For testing I decided to stick with minitest and implement RSpec after I feel
comfortable testing rails apps. Last time I used [slim](http://slim-lang.com/)
as a html template and will use it again since I like it. PostgreSQL is used as
a database since it goes well with [heroku](www.heroku.com) where I will deploy
the app.
